# Rust React Chat Project

This project is a chat application built using Rust and React. It uses SQLite for data storage and Diesel as an ORM for interacting with the database.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Backend**: The backend is written in Rust. It handles all the server-side logic, including user authentication, message handling, and database operations. The backend uses Diesel for ORM operations and SQLite as the database.

2. **Frontend**: The frontend is written in React. It provides the user interface for the chat application.
